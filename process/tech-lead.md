# Tech Lead Role

## Why

Why do we need Tech Leads in squads and outcome teams?  I like Pat Kua on the subject:

> **"A good sign of effective tech leadership and a team working together is that everything feels like itâ€™s written by the same developer mindset."**

High maturity self organizing teams require only a very light touch from their tech lead, and possibly don't require the role to exist at all - when developers can talk things out and come to alignment on their own efficiently, set good direction and effectively come up with solutions, the tech lead doesn't need to do much. In teams like this, its their responsibility to stay out of the way, to keep the team rolling. On teams that are still working on attaining this level of maturity, its the role of the tech lead to get them there.

So, what does it take?

## What

In our organization today, it can be a little confusing. Sometimes the phrase "Tech Lead" is used to describe someone like this:

* A highly technical leader that acts as a partner to the Outcome Team Product Owner(s). This relationship is sometimes referred to as the "Entrepreneur/Scientist" relationship - both have areas of specialty, both have important skills to bring to the leadership process for all of the squads on the Outcome Team.

It can also be used to describe someone like this:

* A highly technical leader that is closely associated with a particular *squad* - a senior developer that's sitting with the squad they serve daily. They go to their squad's standup every day, they are deeply knowledgeable of their squad's backlog, they act as a partner to the Iteration Manager and/or Business Analyst on the squad. 

For this article, we'll refer to the first role as an *Architect*, and the second more squad focused role as a *Tech Lead*.

## How

In both cases, these roles at TELUS digital require technical capability, people skills, [architecture and problem solving skills](architecture.md) and determination. The Architect role has more Enterprise Architecture focus for their entire Outcome Team, the Tech Lead has more  focus on Solution Architecture, though both roles will end up collaborating on all of it.

## Differences between leadership roles and Senior Developer

Often leaders have been recognized for outstanding service as a Senior Developer.  This gives them good experience regarding technology problem solving, good instincts to spot problems with specific solutions. However, the old saying goes, ["What got you here won't get you there"](https://www.amazon.ca/What-Got-Here-Wont-There/dp/1401301304). In both roles, it can  be tempting to continue being a major contributor to the code base (particularly when the team is challenged to meet deadlines) - though, this is counter productive. It's important for the Tech Lead and Architect to not get in the way of the team. The leader that takes on too much of their teams' work ends up causing a situation where the other developers have less knowledge of the code being written (as it was written by someone else). This can lead to the team feeling paralyzed; they feel like they don't understand sections of the codebase, which leads to them feeling like they shouldn't change them. When leaders come in and out of a code base without fully embedding themselves in the team's processes and mindset, this can be particularly disruptive. Late night coding sessions result in the team scrambling to understand the codebase the next morning, leaders picking up large un-analyzed sections of the code [leads to inefficiency](smaller-stories.md), and causes lots of disruption. 

In the end, unless Architects and Tech Leads are very careful to avoid this kind of disruption, the team will actually scale less and less over time. The rest of the team, without much to do, will either become bored and move on, or their skills will atrophy. Doing software development work is the critical experience it takes to go from developer to Senior, from Senior to Lead. When Leads take on too much of this work, it robs the team of its own chance to become stronger.
